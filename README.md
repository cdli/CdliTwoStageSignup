Introduction
------------

CdliTwoStageSignup is an extension to [ZfcUser](http://github.com/ZF-Commons/ZfcUser) which converts the new account registration process into a two-stage process where the prospective new user's email address is verified before they are permitted to create a new account:

* Step 1: Email Address Verification
* Step 2: Account Creation

Email Address Verification is performed by sending an email with a registration token to the email address provided by the user in Step 1.  When the user receives the email and clicks on the registration link, they will be directed to the ZfcUser account registration form to complete the registration process.  This ensures that the email address provided by the user is valid and under their control.
